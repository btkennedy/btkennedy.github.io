# About me 
## I have a two year old named Heidi
## She has favorite TV shows
 - [Bluey](www.bluey.tv)  
 Bluey is an Austrailian cartoon about a family of dogs.   
 Episodes highlight imaginative play and important life lessons, while celebrating family.  
 It's even been described as a show about parenting that kids love.  
 - [The Berenstain Bears](berenstainbears.com)  
 The Berenstain Bears is a cartoon based on books that date all the way back to the 1960's.  
 I beleive my daughter likes the opening theme song more than the actual show.
